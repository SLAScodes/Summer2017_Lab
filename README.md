# Summer2017_Lab
Open Coding Practice Lab SLAS Summer 2017

This is the repository for San Leandro Adult School's summer 2017 open coding practice lab. Every enrolled student has their own branch where they must store their work. Students must upload a stated objective for the entire term as well as for each session with the uploaded work demonstrating having reached that objective or demonstrating what was done with the time and resources of the lab that session. That being said, this is a LAB and an AGILE work environment - you can change your objective at any time but you need to have one and to have delivered tangible evidence of at least working towards achieving that.
